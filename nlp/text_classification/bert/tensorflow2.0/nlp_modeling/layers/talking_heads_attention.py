  """Implements Talking-Heads Attention.

  This is an implementation of Talking-Heads Attention based on the paper
  Talking-Heads Attention (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02436): it enhanced
  multi-head attention by including linearprojections across the attention-heads
  dimension, immediately before and after the softmax operation.

  See the base class `tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention` for more details.

  Args:
    num_heads: Number of attention heads.
    key_dim: Size of each attention head for query and key.
    value_dim:  Size of each attention head for value.
    dropout: Dropout probability.
    use_bias: Boolean, whether the dense layers use bias vectors/matrices.
    output_shape: The expected shape of an output tensor, besides the batch and
      sequence dims. If not specified, projects back to the key feature dim.
    attention_axes: axes over which the attention is applied. `None` means
      attention over all axes, but batch, heads, and features.
    return_attention_scores: bool, if `True`, returns the multi-head attention
      scores as an additional output argument.
    kernel_initializer: Initializer for dense layer kernels.
    bias_initializer: Initializer for dense layer biases.
    kernel_regularizer: Regularizer for dense layer kernels.
    bias_regularizer: Regularizer for dense layer biases.
    activity_regularizer: Regularizer for dense layer activity.
    kernel_constraint: Constraint for dense layer kernels.
    bias_constraint: Constraint for dense layer kernels.
