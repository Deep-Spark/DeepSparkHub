## Part One: Preamble

We are opening the entire series of the globally leading MiniCPM edge-side large language models, including the flagship edge-side models MiniCPM-2.4B and MiniCPM-1.2B, as well as the world's most powerful edge multimodal models MiniCPM-V series. The aforementioned weights are completely open for all academic research. Commercial use is also allowed after filling out a registration questionnaire. Community use of the MiniCPM series models must comply with Apache 2.0 and the "MiniCPM Model Community License Agreement."
Therefore, you and the MiniCPM development team agree to the following "MiniCPM Model Community License Agreement":
