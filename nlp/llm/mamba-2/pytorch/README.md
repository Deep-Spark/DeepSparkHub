# Mamba-2 ï¼ˆMegatron-LM)

## Model Description

Mamba-2 is a cutting-edge state space model (SSM) architecture designed as a highly efficient alternative to traditional
Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). It is the second version of the Mamba model and builds on the strengths
of its predecessor by offering faster inference, improved scalability for long sequences, and lower computational
complexity.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

```sh
# prepare Megatron-LM
