# Phi-3

## Model Description

Phi-3 is a family of efficient small language models (SLMs) developed by Microsoft, designed to deliver high performance
while maintaining cost-effectiveness. These models excel in various tasks including language understanding, reasoning,
coding, and mathematical problem-solving. Despite their compact size, Phi-3 models outperform larger models in their
class, offering a balance between computational efficiency and capability. Their open-source nature and optimized
architecture make them ideal for applications requiring lightweight yet powerful language processing solutions across
diverse domains.
