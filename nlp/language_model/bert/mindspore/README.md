# BERT

## Model Description

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking language model that revolutionized
natural language processing. It employs a transformer architecture with bidirectional attention, enabling it to capture
context from both directions in text. Pretrained using Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)
tasks, BERT achieves state-of-the-art results across various NLP tasks through fine-tuning. Its ability to understand
deep contextual relationships in text has made it a fundamental model in modern NLP research and applications.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

Download training dataset(.tf_record), eval dataset(.json), vocab.txt and checkpoint:
bert_large_ascend_v130_enwiki_official_nlp_bs768_loss1.1.ckpt

```sh
cd scripts
mkdir -p squad
```

Please [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert#pre-training-with-bert) download vocab.txt here

- Create fine-tune dataset
  - Download dataset for fine-tuning and evaluation such as Chinese Named Entity

  - We haven't provide the scripts to create tfrecord yet, while converting dataset files from JSON format to TFRECORD
    format, please refer to run_classifier.py or run_squad.py file in [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)
    repository or the CLUE official repository
    [CLUE](https://github.com/CLUEbenchmark/CLUE/blob/master/baselines/models/bert/run_classifier.py) and
