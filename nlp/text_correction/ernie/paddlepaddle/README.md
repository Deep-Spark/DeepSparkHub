# ERNIE

## Model Description

ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration) is a family of large-scale pre-trained language models
developed by Baidu. ERNIE is designed to improve on traditional language models by incorporating knowledge from various
sources, such as structured knowledge graphs, and by integrating multiple linguistic features, including syntax,
semantics, and common sense. The model achieves this by using a knowledge-enhanced pre-training approach, which helps
ERNIE better understand and generate more accurate and contextually aware language representations.
