# YOLOv5

## Model Description

YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that builds upon the YOLO architecture, offering improved speed and
accuracy. It features a streamlined design with enhanced data augmentation and anchor box strategies. YOLOv5 supports
multiple model sizes (n/s/m/l/x) for different performance needs. The model is known for its ease of use, fast training,
and efficient inference, making it popular for real-time detection tasks across various applications.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

```bash
# Install libGL
## CentOS
yum install -y mesa-libGL
## Ubuntu
apt install -y libgl1-mesa-glx

git clone -b release/2.7 --depth=1 https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleYOLO.git
cd PaddleYOLO/

python3 dataset/coco/download_coco.py
or
ln -s /path/to/coco2017 dataset/coco
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py develop
```

## Model Training

```bash
# Make sure your dataset path is the same as above
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
# Select $config_yaml from "configs/yolov5" as you wish
config_yaml=configs/yolov5/yolov5_s_300e_coco.yml
python3 -m paddle.distributed.launch --gpus 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 tools/train.py -c ${config_yaml} --amp --eval
```
