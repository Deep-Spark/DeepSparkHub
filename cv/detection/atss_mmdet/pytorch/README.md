# ATSS

## Model description

Object detection has been dominated by anchor-based detectors for several years. Recently, anchor-free detectors have become popular due to the proposal of FPN and Focal Loss. In this paper, we first point out that the essential difference between anchor-based and anchor-free detection is actually how to define positive and negative training samples, which leads to the performance gap between them. If they adopt the same definition of positive and negative samples during training, there is no obvious difference in the final performance, no matter regressing from a box or a point. This shows that how to select positive and negative training samples is important for current object detectors. Then, we propose an Adaptive Training Sample Selection (ATSS) to automatically select positive and negative samples according to statistical characteristics of object. It significantly improves the performance of anchor-based and anchor-free detectors and bridges the gap between them. Finally, we discuss the necessity of tiling multiple anchors per location on the image to detect objects. Extensive experiments conducted on MS COCO support our aforementioned analysis and conclusions. With the newly introduced ATSS, we improve state-of-the-art detectors by a large margin to 50.7% AP without introducing any overhead.

## Step 1: Installation

ATSS model is using MMDetection toolbox. Before you run this model, you need to setup MMDetection first.

```bash
# Install libGL
## CentOS
yum install -y mesa-libGL
## Ubuntu
apt install -y libgl1-mesa-glx

# install MMDetection
git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git -b v3.3.0 --depth=1
cd mmdetection
pip install -v -e .
```

## Step 2: Preparing datasets

Go to visit [COCO official website](https://cocodataset.org/#download), then select the COCO dataset you want to download.

Take coco2017 dataset as an example, specify `/path/to/coco2017` to your COCO path in later training process, the unzipped dataset path structure sholud look like:

```bash
coco2017
├── annotations
│   ├── instances_train2017.json
│   ├── instances_val2017.json
│   └── ...
├── train2017
│   ├── 000000000009.jpg
│   ├── 000000000025.jpg
│   └── ...
├── val2017
│   ├── 000000000139.jpg
│   ├── 000000000285.jpg
│   └── ...
├── train2017.txt
├── val2017.txt
└── ...
```

## Step 3: Training

```bash
# Make soft link to dataset
cd mmdetection/
mkdir -p data/
ln -s /path/to/coco2017 data/coco

# Prepare resnet50-0676ba61.pth, skip this if fast network
mkdir -p /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/
wget https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet50-0676ba61.pth -O /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/resnet50-0676ba61.pth

# On single GPU
python3 tools/train.py configs/atss/atss_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py

sed -i 's/python /python3 /g' tools/dist_train.sh

# Multiple GPUs on one machine
bash tools/dist_train.sh configs/atss/atss_r50_fpn_1x_coco.py 8
```

## Results

|     GPUs    | FP32                                 | 
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| BI-V100 x8  | MAP=39.5                             |
