# RetinaNet

## Model Description

RetinaNet is a state-of-the-art object detection model that addresses the class imbalance problem in dense detection
through its novel Focal Loss. It uses a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone to detect objects at multiple scales
efficiently. RetinaNet achieves high accuracy while maintaining competitive speed, making it suitable for various
detection tasks. Its single-stage architecture combines the accuracy of two-stage detectors with the speed of
single-stage approaches, offering an excellent balance between performance and efficiency.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

Go to visit [COCO official website](https://cocodataset.org/#download), then select the COCO dataset you want to
download.

Take coco2017 dataset as an example, specify `/path/to/coco2017` to your COCO path in later training process, the
unzipped dataset path structure sholud look like:

```bash
coco2017
├── annotations
│   ├── instances_train2017.json
│   ├── instances_val2017.json
│   └── ...
├── train2017
│   ├── 000000000009.jpg
│   ├── 000000000025.jpg
│   └── ...
├── val2017
│   ├── 000000000139.jpg
│   ├── 000000000285.jpg
│   └── ...
├── train2017.txt
├── val2017.txt
└── ...
```

### Install Dependencies

```shell
pip3 install 'scipy' 'matplotlib' 'pycocotools' 'opencv-python' 'easydict' 'tqdm'
```

## Model Training

```shell
# Multiple GPUs on one machine
bash train_retinanet_r50_dist.sh --data-path /path/to/coco2017/ --dataset coco
```
