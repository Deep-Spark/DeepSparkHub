# InceptionV3

## Model description
Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network architecture from the Inception family that makes several improvements including using Label Smoothing, Factorized 7 x 7 convolutions, and the use of an auxiliary classifer to propagate label information lower down the network (along with the use of batch normalization for layers in the sidehead).

## Step 1: Installation

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Preparing datasets

Sign up and login in [ImageNet official website](https://www.image-net.org/index.php), then choose 'Download' to download the whole ImageNet dataset. Specify `/path/to/imagenet` to your ImageNet path in later training process.

The ImageNet dataset path structure should look like:

```bash
imagenet
├── train
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── n01440764_10026.JPEG
│       └── ...
├── train_list.txt
├── val
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── ILSVRC2012_val_00000293.JPEG
│       └── ...
└── val_list.txt
```

## Step 3: Training


```bash
# Set data path
export DATA_PATH=/path/to/imagenet

# Multiple GPUs on one machine (AMP)
bash train_inception_v3_amp_dist.sh
```
