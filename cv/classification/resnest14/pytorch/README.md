# ResNeSt14

## Model Description

ResNeSt14 is a lightweight convolutional neural network that combines ResNet architecture with Split-Attention blocks.
It introduces channel-wise attention mechanisms to enhance feature representation, using adaptive feature aggregation
across multiple groups. The architecture achieves efficient performance in image classification tasks by balancing model
complexity and computational efficiency. ResNeSt14's design is particularly suitable for applications with limited
resources, offering improved accuracy over standard ResNet variants while maintaining fast training and inference
capabilities.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

Sign up and login in [ImageNet official website](https://www.image-net.org/index.php), then choose 'Download' to
download the whole ImageNet dataset. Specify `/path/to/imagenet` to your ImageNet path in later training process.

The ImageNet dataset path structure should look like:

```bash
imagenet
├── train
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── n01440764_10026.JPEG
│       └── ...
├── train_list.txt
├── val
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── ILSVRC2012_val_00000293.JPEG
│       └── ...
└── val_list.txt
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training

Set data path by `export DATA_PATH=/path/to/imagenet`. The following command uses all cards to train:

```bash
# Multiple GPUs on one machine (AMP)
bash train_resnest14_amp_dist.sh
```
