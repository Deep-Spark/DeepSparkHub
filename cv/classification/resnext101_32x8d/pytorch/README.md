# ResNeXt101_32x8d

## Model Description

ResNeXt101 is a deep convolutional network that extends ResNet architecture by introducing cardinality as a new
dimension. The 32x8d variant uses 32 groups with 8-dimensional transformations in each block. This grouped convolution
approach improves feature representation while maintaining computational efficiency. ResNeXt101 achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks by combining the benefits of residual learning with
multi-branch transformations. Its architecture is particularly effective for large-scale visual recognition tasks,
offering improved accuracy over standard ResNet models.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

Sign up and login in [ImageNet official website](https://www.image-net.org/index.php), then choose 'Download' to
download the whole ImageNet dataset. Specify `/path/to/imagenet` to your ImageNet path in later training process.

The ImageNet dataset path structure should look like:

```bash
imagenet
├── train
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── n01440764_10026.JPEG
│       └── ...
├── train_list.txt
├── val
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── ILSVRC2012_val_00000293.JPEG
│       └── ...
└── val_list.txt
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training

Set data path by `export DATA_PATH=/path/to/imagenet`. The following command uses all cards to train:

```bash
# Multiple GPUs on one machine
bash train_resnext101_32x8d_amp_dist.sh
```
