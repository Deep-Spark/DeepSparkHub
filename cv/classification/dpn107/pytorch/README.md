# DPN107

## Model Description

DPN107 is an advanced dual-path network that combines the feature reuse capability of ResNet with the feature
exploration of DenseNet. This architecture enables efficient learning by maintaining two parallel paths: one for
preserving important features and another for discovering new ones. DPN107 achieves state-of-the-art performance in
image classification tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Its unique design makes it particularly effective
for complex visual recognition tasks, offering a balance between model accuracy and resource utilization.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

Sign up and login in [ImageNet official website](https://www.image-net.org/index.php), then choose 'Download' to
download the whole ImageNet dataset. Specify `/path/to/imagenet` to your ImageNet path in later training process.

The ImageNet dataset path structure should look like:

```bash
imagenet
├── train
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── n01440764_10026.JPEG
│       └── ...
├── train_list.txt
├── val
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── ILSVRC2012_val_00000293.JPEG
│       └── ...
└── val_list.txt
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training

Set data path by `export DATA_PATH=/path/to/imagenet`. The following command uses all cards to train:

```bash
# Multiple GPUs on one machine (AMP)
bash train_dpn107_amp_dist.sh
```
