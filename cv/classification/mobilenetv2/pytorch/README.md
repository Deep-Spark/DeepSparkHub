# MobileNetV2

## Model Description

MobileNetV2 is an efficient convolutional neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It
introduces inverted residual blocks with linear bottlenecks, using depthwise separable convolutions to reduce
computational complexity. This architecture maintains high accuracy while significantly decreasing model size and
latency compared to traditional CNNs. MobileNetV2's design focuses on balancing performance and efficiency, making it
ideal for real-time applications on resource-constrained devices like smartphones and IoT devices.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

Sign up and login in [ImageNet official website](https://www.image-net.org/index.php), then choose 'Download' to
download the whole ImageNet dataset. Specify `/path/to/imagenet` to your ImageNet path in later training process.

The ImageNet dataset path structure should look like:

```bash
imagenet
├── train
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── n01440764_10026.JPEG
│       └── ...
├── train_list.txt
├── val
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── ILSVRC2012_val_00000293.JPEG
│       └── ...
└── val_list.txt
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training

Set data path by `export DATA_PATH=/path/to/imagenet`. The following command uses all cards to train:

```bash
# Multiple GPUs on one machine (AMP)
bash train_mobilenet_v2_amp_dist.sh
```
