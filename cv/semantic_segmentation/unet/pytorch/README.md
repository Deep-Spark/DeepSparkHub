# UNet

## Model description

A network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently.
The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. 


## Step 1: Installing

### Install packages

```shell

pip3 install 'scipy' 'matplotlib' 'pycocotools' 'opencv-python' 'easydict' 'tqdm'

```

## Step 2: Training

#### Training on COCO dataset

```shell
bash train_unet_dist.sh --data-path /path/to/coco2017/ --dataset coco
```
