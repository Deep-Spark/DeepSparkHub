# UNet++: A Nested U-Net Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation

## Model description

We present UNet++, a new, more powerful architecture for medical image segmentation. Our architecture is essentially
a deeply-supervised encoder-decoder network where the encoder and decoder sub-networks are connected through a series of nested, dense skip
pathways. The re-designed skip pathways aim at reducing the semantic
gap between the feature maps of the encoder and decoder sub-networks.
We argue that the optimizer would deal with an easier learning task when
the feature maps from the decoder and encoder networks are semantically
similar.
## Step 1: Installing

### Install packages

```shell
yum install mesa-libGL
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
wget http://www.zlib.net/fossils/zlib-1.2.9.tar.gz
tar xvf zlib-1.2.9.tar.gz
cd zlib-1.2.9/
./configure && make install
```

### Build Extension

```shell
python3 setup.py build && cp build/lib.linux*/mmcv/_ext.cpython* mmcv
```

## Step 2: Prepare Datasets

### If there is DRIVE dataset locally

```shell
mkdir -p data/
ln -s ${DRIVE_DATASET_PATH} data/
```

### If there is not DRIVE dataset locally

Download DRIVE from file server or official website [DRIVE](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/)

```shell
python3 tools/convert_datasets/drive.py /path/to/training.zip /path/to/test.zip
```

## Step 3: Training

**The available configs are as follows:**

```shell

# DRIVE
unet++_r34_40k_drive


### Training on mutil-cards
```shell
bash train_dist.sh <config file> <num_gpus> [training args]    # config file can be found in the configs directory 
```

### Example

```shell
bash train_dist.sh configs/unet++/unet++_r34_40k_drive.py 8
```

### Training arguments

```python
# the dir to save logs and models
work-dir: str = None

# the checkpoint file to load weights from
load-from: str = None

# the checkpoint file to resume from
resume-from: str = None

# whether not to evaluate the checkpoint during training
no-validate: bool = False

# (Deprecated, please use --gpu-id) number of gpus to 
# use (only applicable to non-distributed training)
gpus: int = None

# (Deprecated, please use --gpu-id) ids of gpus to use 
# (only applicable to non-distributed training)
gpu-ids: int = None

# id of gpu to use (only applicable to non-distributed training)
gpu-id: int = 0

# random seed
seed: int = None

# Whether or not set different seeds for different ranks
diff_seed: bool = False

# whether to set deterministic options for CUDNN backend.
deterministic: bool = False

# --options is deprecated in favor of --cfg_options' and it 
# will not be supported in version v0.22.0. Override some 
# settings in the used config, the key-value pair in xxx=yyy 
# format will be merged into config file. If the value to be 
# overwritten is a list, it should be like key="[a,b]" or key=a,b 
# It also allows nested list/tuple values, e.g. key="[(a,b),(c,d)]" 
# Note that the quotation marks are necessary and that no white space 
# is allowed.
options: str = None

cfg-options: str = None

# job launcher

# local rank
local_rank: int = 0

# distributed backend
dist_backend: str = None

# resume from the latest checkpoint automatically.
auto-resume: bool = False
```
