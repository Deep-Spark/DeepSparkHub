## Model Description

Recently, segmentation-based methods are quite popular in scene text detection, as the segmentation results can more
accurately describe scene text of various shapes such as curve text. However, the post-processing of binarization is
essential for segmentation-based detection, which converts probability maps produced by a segmentation method into
bounding boxes/regions of text. In this paper, we propose a module named Differentiable Binarization (DB), which can
perform the binarization process in a segmentation network. Optimized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can
adaptively set the thresholds for binarization, which not only simplifies the post-processing but also enhances the
performance of text detection. Based on a simple segmentation network, we validate the performance improvements of DB on
five benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and
speed. In particular, with a light-weight backbone, the performance improvements by DB are significant so that we can
look for an ideal tradeoff between detection accuracy and efficiency.
