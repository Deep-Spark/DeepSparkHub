# CRNN

## Model Description

CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) is an end-to-end trainable model for image-based sequence recognition,
particularly effective for scene text recognition. It combines convolutional layers for feature extraction with
recurrent layers for sequence modeling, followed by a transcription layer. CRNN handles sequences of arbitrary lengths
without character segmentation or horizontal scaling, making it versatile for both lexicon-free and lexicon-based text
recognition tasks. Its compact architecture and unified framework make it practical for real-world applications like
document analysis and OCR.
