# ECA ResNet152

## Model Description

ECA ResNet152 is an enhanced version of ResNet152 that incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module. This
module improves feature representation by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise feature responses without dimensionality
reduction. The ECA mechanism boosts model performance while maintaining computational efficiency. ECA ResNet152 achieves
superior accuracy in image classification tasks compared to standard ResNet152, making it particularly effective for
complex visual recognition problems. Its architecture balances performance and efficiency, making it suitable for
various computer vision applications.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

Sign up and login in [ImageNet official website](https://www.image-net.org/index.php), then choose 'Download' to
download the whole ImageNet dataset. Specify `/path/to/imagenet` to your ImageNet path in later training process.

The ImageNet dataset path structure should look like:

```bash
imagenet
├── train
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── n01440764_10026.JPEG
│       └── ...
├── train_list.txt
├── val
│   └── n01440764
│       ├── ILSVRC2012_val_00000293.JPEG
│       └── ...
└── val_list.txt
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Training

Set data path by `export DATA_PATH=/path/to/imagenet`. The following command uses all cards to train:

```bash
# Multiple GPUs on one machine (AMP)
bash train_eca_resnet152_amp_dist.sh
```
