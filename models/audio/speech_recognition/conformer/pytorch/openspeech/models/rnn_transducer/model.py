    r"""
    RNN-Transducer are a form of sequence-to-sequence models that do not employ attention mechanisms.
    Unlike most sequence-to-sequence models, which typically need to process the entire input sequence
    (the waveform in our case) to produce an output (the sentence), the RNN-T continuously processes input samples and
    streams output symbols, a property that is welcome for speech dictation. In our implementation,
    the output symbols are the characters of the alphabet.

    Args:
        configs (DictConfig): configuration set.
        tokenizer (Tokenizer): tokenizer is in charge of preparing the inputs for a model.

    Inputs:
        - **inputs** (torch.FloatTensor): A input sequence passed to encoders. Typically for inputs this will be a padded `FloatTensor` of size ``(batch, seq_length, dimension)``.
        - **input_lengths** (torch.LongTensor): The length of input tensor. ``(batch)``

    Returns:
        outputs (dict): Result of model predictions.
