@register_audio_feature_transform("mfcc", dataclass=MFCCConfigs)
class MFCCFeatureTransform(object):
    r"""
    Create the Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients from an audio signal.

    By default, this calculates the MFCC on the DB-scaled Mel spectrogram.
    This is not the textbook implementation, but is implemented here to
    give consistency with librosa.

    This output depends on the maximum value in the input spectrogram, and so
    may return different values for an audio clip split into snippets vs. a
    a full clip.

    Args:
        configs (DictConfig): configuraion set

    Returns:
        Tensor: A mfcc feature. The shape is ``(seq_length, num_mels)``
