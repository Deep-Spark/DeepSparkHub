class CrossEntropyLoss(nn.Module):
    r"""
    The negative log likelihood loss. It is useful to train a classification
    problem with `C` classes.

    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D Tensor assigning
    weight to each of the classes. This is particularly useful when you have an
    unbalanced training set.

    The `input` given through a forward call is expected to contain
    log-probabilities of each class. `input` has to be a Tensor of size either
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case (described later).

    Obtaining log-probabilities in a neural network is easily achieved by
    adding a  `LogSoftmax`  layer in the last layer of your network.
    You may use `CrossEntropyLoss` instead, if you prefer not to add an extra
    layer.

    The `target` that this loss expects should be a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]`
    where `C = number of classes`; if `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts
    this class index (this index may not necessarily be in the class range).

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_{y_n} x_{n,y_n}, \quad
        w_{c} = \text{weight}[c] \cdot \mathbb{1}\{c \not= \text{ignore\_index}\},

    where :math:`x` is the input, :math:`y` is the target, :math:`w` is the weight, and
    :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n}} l_n, &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    Can also be used for higher dimension inputs, such as 2D images, by providing
    an input of size :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`,
    where :math:`K` is the number of dimensions, and a target of appropriate shape
    (see below). In the case of images, it computes NLL loss per-pixel.

    Args:
        configs (DictConfig): hydra configuration set
        tokenizer (Tokenizer): tokenizer is in charge of preparing the inputs for a model.

    Inputs: logits, targets
        - logits (torch.FloatTensor): probability distribution value from model and it has a logarithm shape.
            The `FloatTensor` of size ``(batch, seq_length, num_classes)``
        - targets (torch.LongTensor): ground-truth encoded to integers which directly point a word in label.
            The `LongTensor` of size ``(batch, target_length)``

    Returns: loss
        * loss (float): loss for training

    Examples::

        >>> B, T1, C, T2 = 3, 128, 4, 10
        >>> loss = CrossEntropyLoss()
        >>> inputs = torch.randn(B, T1, C, requires_grad=True)
        >>> targets = torch.empty(B, T2, dtype=torch.long).random_(T2)
        >>> outputs = loss(inputs, targets)
        >>> outputs.backward()
