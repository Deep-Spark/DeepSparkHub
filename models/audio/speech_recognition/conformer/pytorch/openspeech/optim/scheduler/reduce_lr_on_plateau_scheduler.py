    Reduce learning rate when a metric has stopped improving. Models often benefit from reducing the learning rate by
    a factor of 2-10 once learning stagnates. This scheduler reads a metrics quantity and if no improvement is seen
    for a ‘patience’ number of epochs, the learning rate is reduced.
