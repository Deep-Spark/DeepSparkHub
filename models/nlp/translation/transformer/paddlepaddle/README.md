# Transformer

## Model Description

The Transformer model, introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al., revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). Unlike
traditional models like RNNs or LSTMs, the Transformer relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms to process input
data in parallel, rather than sequentially. This allows it to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and scale
efficiently to large datasets. The model consists of an encoder-decoder architecture, where both components use
multi-head attention and position-wise feed-forward networks. Transformers have become the foundation for many
state-of-the-art models like BERT, GPT, and T5, driving advancements in machine translation, text generation, and other
NLP tasks.
