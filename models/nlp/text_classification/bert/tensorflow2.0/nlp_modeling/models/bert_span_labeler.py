  """Span labeler model based on a BERT-style transformer-based encoder.

  This is an implementation of the network structure surrounding a transformer
  encoder as described in "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers
  for Language Understanding" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).

  The BertSpanLabeler allows a user to pass in a transformer encoder, and
  instantiates a span labeling network based on a single dense layer.

  *Note* that the model is constructed by
  [Keras Functional API](https://keras.io/guides/functional_api/).

  Args:
    network: A transformer network. This network should output a sequence output
      and a classification output. Furthermore, it should expose its embedding
      table via a `get_embedding_table` method.
    initializer: The initializer (if any) to use in the span labeling network.
      Defaults to a Glorot uniform initializer.
    output: The output style for this network. Can be either `logit`' or
      `predictions`.
