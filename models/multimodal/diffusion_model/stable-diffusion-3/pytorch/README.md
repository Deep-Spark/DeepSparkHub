# Stable Diffusion 3

## Model Description

Stable Diffusion 3 represents the latest evolution in text-to-image generation technology, offering unprecedented
capabilities in creating photorealistic images from textual descriptions. This advanced latent diffusion model
incorporates cutting-edge architectural improvements and training techniques, resulting in enhanced image quality and
prompt comprehension. With its ability to generate highly detailed and contextually accurate visuals, Stable Diffusion 3
pushes the boundaries of AI-assisted creativity. The model maintains efficient processing through its latent space
operations while delivering state-of-the-art results in image synthesis and generation.

## Model Preparation

### Prepare Resources

You just need to run the script, and it will automatically download the required data and weights. Or you can manually
download the weights and data locally.

#### Weights

Download the stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers from [huggingface
page](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers).

#### Datasets

dataset: download the diffusers/dog-example from [huggingface
page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/diffusers/dog-example).

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install http://files.deepspark.org.cn:880/deepspark/add-ons/diffusers-0.29.0-py3-none-any.whl
pip3 install http://files.deepspark.org.cn:880/deepspark/add-ons/transformers-4.38.1-py3-none-any.whl
pip3 install -r ../diffusers/requirements.txt
pip3 install pillow --upgrade
```

## Model Training

If you have downloaded the weights and dataset, please export the environment variables like below.

```bash
export MODEL_PATH=/path/to/sd_weights
export DATASET_PATH=/path/to/data
```

```bash
# Go to diffusers path
cd ${PROJ_ROOT}/toolbox/diffusers

# train
bash run_sd3_dreambooth.sh
```

## Model Results
