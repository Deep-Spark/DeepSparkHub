class BeamSearchCTC(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Decodes probability output using ctcdecode package.

    Args:
        labels (list): the tokens you used to train your model
        lm_path (str): the path to your external kenlm language model(LM).
        alpha (int): weighting associated with the LMs probabilities.
        beta (int): weight associated with the number of words within our beam
        cutoff_top_n (int): cutoff number in pruning. Only the top cutoff_top_n characters with the highest probability
            in the vocab will be used in beam search.
        cutoff_prob (float): cutoff probability in pruning. 1.0 means no pruning.
        beam_size (int): this controls how broad the beam search is.
        num_processes (int): parallelize the batch using num_processes workers.
        blank_id (int): this should be the index of the CTC blank token

    Inputs: logits, sizes
        - logits: Tensor of character probabilities, where probs[c,t] is the probability of character c at time t
        - sizes: Size of each sequence in the mini-batch

    Returns:
        - outputs: sequences of the model's best prediction
