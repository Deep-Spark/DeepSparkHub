    r"""
    Language model perplexity loss.
    Perplexity is the token averaged likelihood.  When the averaging options are the
    same, it is the exponential of negative log-likelihood.

    Args:
        configs (DictConfig): hydra configuration set
        tokenizer (Tokenizer): tokenizer is in charge of preparing the inputs for a model.

    Inputs: logits, targets
        - **logits** (torch.FloatTensor): probability distribution value from model and it has a logarithm shape.
            The `FloatTensor` of size ``(batch, seq_length, num_classes)``
        - **targets** (torch.LongTensor): ground-truth encoded to integers which directly point a word in label
            The `LongTensor` of size ``(batch, target_length)``

    Returns: loss
        - loss (float): loss for training
