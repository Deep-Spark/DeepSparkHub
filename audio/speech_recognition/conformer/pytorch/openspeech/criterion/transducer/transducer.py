@register_criterion("transducer", dataclass=TransducerLossConfigs)
class TransducerLoss(nn.Module):
    r"""
    Compute path-aware regularization transducer loss.

    Args:
        configs (DictConfig): hydra configuration set
        tokenizer (Tokenizer): tokenizer is in charge of preparing the inputs for a model.

    Inputs:
        logits (torch.FloatTensor): Input tensor with shape (N, T, U, V)
            where N is the minibatch size, T is the maximum number of
            input frames, U is the maximum number of output labels and V is
            the vocabulary of labels (including the blank).
        targets (torch.IntTensor): Tensor with shape (N, U-1) representing the
            reference labels for all samples in the minibatch.
        input_lengths (torch.IntTensor): Tensor with shape (N,) representing the
            number of frames for each sample in the minibatch.
        target_lengths (torch.IntTensor): Tensor with shape (N,) representing the
            length of the transcription for each sample in the minibatch.

    Returns:
        - loss (torch.FloatTensor): transducer loss
