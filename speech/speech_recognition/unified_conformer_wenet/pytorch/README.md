# Unified Conformer

## Model description
Unified Conformer is an architecture that has become state-of-the-art in the field of
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It is a variant of the Transformer architecture which
has achieved extraordinary performance in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision
tasks thanks to its powerful self-attention mechanismÂ¹. The Conformer architecture has
been modified from ASR to Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) with very minor changes.

## Step 1: Installation

```bash
cd ../../../../toolbox/WeNet/
bash install_toolbox_wenet.sh
```

## Step 2: Training

Dataset is data_aishell.tgz and resource_aishell.tgz from wenet.
You could just run the whole script, which will download the dataset automatically.

**You need to modify the path of the dataset in run.sh.**

```bash
# Change to the scripts path
cd wenet/examples/aishell/s0/

# Configure data path and model name
export data_path="/path/to/aishell"
export model_name="unified_conformer"

# Run all stages
bash run.sh --stage -1 --stop-stage 6
```

Or you also run each stage one by one manually and check the result to understand the whole process.  

```bash
# Download data
bash run.sh --stage -1 --stop-stage -1
# Prepare Training data
bash run.sh --stage 0 --stop-stage 0
# Extract optinal cmvn features
bash run.sh --stage 1 --stop-stage 1
# Generate label token dictionary
bash run.sh --stage 2 --stop-stage 2
# Prepare WeNet data format
bash run.sh --stage 3 --stop-stage 3
# Neural Network training
bash run.sh --stage 4 --stop-stage 4
# Recognize wav using the trained model
bash run.sh --stage 5 --stop-stage 5
# Export the trained model
bash run.sh --stage 6 --stop-stage 6
```

## Results

| GPUs | FP16  | QPS | WER(ctc_greedy_search)| WER(ctc_prefix_beam_search) | WER(attention) | WER(attention_rescoring)|
