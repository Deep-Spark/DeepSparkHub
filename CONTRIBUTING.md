* Uploaded content should contain only scripts, code, and documentation. Do not upload any data sets or directories/files generated during execution.
* The code for each model should be its own closure that can be migrated and used independently. 
* Do not include any of your personal information, such as your host IP, personal password, local directory, etc.
* Be sure to specify any additional Python libraries required with corresponding versions (if explicitly required) in the 'requirements.txt' file.
* The submitted code should be fully reviewed and self-checked and ideally passed by CI test.
* Don't forget to create a README.md file under model’s root directory, update model info by referring to the format of [Model Description Template](README_TEMPLATE.md).
